abstract = {Simulation-based weather and climate prediction now involves the use of methods that reflect a deep concern with uncertainty. These methods, known as ensemble prediction methods, produce multiple simulations for predictive periods of interest, using different initial conditions, parameter values and/or model structures. This paper provides a non-technical overview of current ensemble methods and considers how the results of studies employing these methods should be interpreted, paying special attention to probabilistic interpretations. A key conclusion is that, while complicated inductive arguments might be given for the trustworthiness of probabilistic weather forecasts obtained from ensemble studies, analogous arguments are out of reach in the case of long-term climate prediction. In light of this, the paper considers how predictive uncertainty should be conveyed to decision makers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The concept of a classifier competence is fundamental to multiple classifier systems (MCSs). In this study, a method for calculating the classifier competence is developed using a probabilistic model. In the method, first a randomised reference classifier (RRC) whose class supports are realisations of the random variables with beta probability distributions is constructed. The parameters of the distributions are chosen in such a way that, for each feature vector in a validation set, the expected values of the class supports produced by the RRC and the class supports produced by a modelled classifier are equal. This allows for using the probability of correct classification of the RRC as the competence of the modelled classifier. The competences calculated for a validation set are then generalised to an entire feature space by constructing a competence function based on a potential function model or regression. Three systems based on a dynamic classifier selection and a dynamic ensemble selection (DES) were constructed using the method developed. The DES based system had statistically significant higher average rank than the ones of eight benchmark MCSs for 22 data sets and a heterogeneous ensemble. The results obtained indicate that the full vector of class supports should be used for evaluating the classifier competence as this potentially improves performance of MCSs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An important goal of knowledge discovery is the search for patterns in data that can help ex- plain the underlying process that generated the data. The patterns are required to be new, useful, and understandable to humans. In this work we present a new method for the under- standable description of local temporal relationships in multivariate data, called Time Series Knowledge Mining (TSKM). We define the Time Series Knowledge Representation (TSKR) as a new language for expressing temporal knowledge. The patterns have a hierarchical structure, each level corresponds to a single temporal concept. On the lowest level, intervals are used to represent duration. Overlapping parts of intervals represent coincidence on the next level. Several such blocks of intervals are connected with a partial order relation on the highest level. Each pattern element consists of a semiotic triple to connect syntactic and semantic information with pragmatics. The patterns are very compact, but offer details for each element on demand. In comparison with related approaches, the TSKR is shown to have advantages in robustness, expressivity, and comprehensibility. Efficient algorithms for the discovery of the patterns are proposed. The search for coincidence as well as partial order can be formulated as variants of the well known frequent itemset problem. One of the best known algorithms for this problem is therefore adapted for our purposes. Human interaction is used during the mining to analyze and validate partial results as early as possible and guide further processing steps. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using several data sets. In an application to sports medicine the results were recognized as valid and useful by an expert of the field.},

abstract = {In handwritten pattern recognition, the multiple classifier system has been shown to be useful for improving recognition rates. One of the most important tasks in optimizing a multiple classifier system is to select a group of adequate classifiers, known as an Ensemble of Classifiers (EoC), from a pool of classifiers. Static selection schemes select an EoC for all test patterns, and dynamic selection schemes select different classifiers for different test patterns. Nevertheless, it has been shown that traditional dynamic selection performs no better than static selection. We propose four new dynamic selection schemes which explore the properties of the oracle concept. Our results suggest that the proposed schemes, using the majority voting rule for combining classifiers, perform better than the static selection method. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A novel and flexible approach is proposed based on segmental semi-Markov models. Unlike dynamic time-warping or template-matching, the proposed framework provides a principled and coherent framework for leveraging both prior knowledge and training data. The pattern of interest is modeled as a K-state segmental hidden Markov model where each state is responsible for the generation of a component of the overall shape using a stet-based regression function. The distance (in time) between segments can be constructed from a single training example. Recognition of a pattern in a new time series is achieved by recursive Viterbi-like algorithm which scales linearly in the length of the sequence. The method is successfully demonstrated on real data sets, including an application to end-point detection in semiconductor manufacturing.},

abstract = {Under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization, there are a number of international initiatives to promote the development and use of so-called ensemble prediction systems (EPS) for flood forecasting. The campaign to apply these meteorological techniques to flood forecasting raises important questions about how the probabilistic information these systems provide can be used for what in operational terms is typically a binary decision of whether or not to issue a flood warning. To explore these issues, we report on the results of a series of focus group discussions conducted with operational flood forecasters from across Europe on behalf of the European Flood Alert System. Working in small groups to simulate operational conditions, forecasters engaged in a series of carefully designed forecasting exercises using various different combinations of actual data from real events. Focus group data was supplemented by a follow-up questionnaire survey exploring how flood forecasters understand risk, uncertainty, and error. Results suggest that flood forecasters may not instinctively use ensemble predictions in the way that promoters of EPS perhaps think they should. The paper concludes by exploring the implications of these divergent 'epistemic cultures' for efforts to apply ensemble prediction techniques developed in the context of weather forecasting to the rather different one of flood forecasting. ?? 2007.},

The authors investigate the relationship between spread and skill in an operational setting by analyzing ensemble predictions produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The geographical dependence of the spread-skill relationship is found to be related to the geographical dependence of day-to-day variability of spread. Dynamical mechanisms for spread variability are investigated using a linear quasigeostrophic model.

The probability score (or half Brier score) is used to evaluate the quality of probabilistic forecasts of a single binary event. The skill of an EPS is assessed by comparing its performance, in terms of the probability score, to the performance of a reference probabilistic forecast. The reference forecast is based on the control forecast of the system under consideration, using model error statistics to estimate a probability distribution. A decomposition of the skill score is applied in order to distinguish between the two main aspects of the forecast performance: reliability and resolution.

Its focus is on the entire permissible range of a certain (weather) parameter. The CRPS can be seen as a ranked probability score with an infinite number of classes, each of zero width. Alternatively, it can be interpreted as the integral of the Brier score over all possible threshold values for the parameter under consideration. For a deterministic forecast system the CRPS reduces to the mean absolute error. In this paper it is shown that for an ensemble prediction system the CRPS can be decomposed into a reliability part and a resolution/uncertainty part, in a way that is similar to the decomposition of the Brier score. The reliability part of the CRPS is closely connected to the rank histogram of the ensemble, while the resolution/uncertainty part can be related to the average spread within the ensemble and the behavior of its outliers.

abstract = {With the growing importance of time series clustering research, particularly for similarity searches amongst long time series such as those arising in medicine or finance, it is critical for us to find a way to resolve the outstanding problems thatmakemost clusteringmethods impractical under certain circumstances. When the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle missing data when the clustering is based on a distance metric. This paper proposes a method for clustering of time series based on their structural characteristics. Unlike other alternatives, this method does not cluster point values using a distance metric, rather it clusters based on global features extracted from the time series. The feature measures are obtained from each individual series and can be fed into arbitrary clustering algorithms, including an unsupervised neural network algorithm, self-organizing map, or hierarchal clustering algorithm. Global measures describing the time series are obtained by applying statistical operations that best capture the underlying characteristics: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, chaos, nonlinearity, and self-similarity. Since the method clusters using extracted global measures, it reduces the dimensionality of the time series and is much less sensitive to missing or noisy data. We further provide a search mechanism to find the best selection from the feature set that should be used as the clustering inputs. The proposed technique has been tested using benchmark time series datasets previously reported for time series clustering and a set of time series datasets with known characteristics. The empirical results show that our approach is able to yield meaningful clusters. The resulting clusters are similar to those produced by other methods, but with some promising and interesting variations that can be intuitively explained with knowledge of the global characteristics of the time series.
